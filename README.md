Watch Turing Machines

## Overview

A little Turing Machine viewer

The matrix represents the transition rules, a row for each state, two columns
 one for each possible input 0,1 then a vector of `[next-state output motion]`

## Building

(use 'done.build.build) (cljs-build)

Or, in IntelliJ setup a figwheel repl and use done.build.figs in the parameters
